// This file would contain a base64-encoded map image placeholder
// For this demo, we'll use a sample map image from an online source
// In a real implementation, you would generate a static map image 
// or integrate with a mapping service API like Google Maps, Mapbox, or Leaflet

// The file will be served from the public directory
